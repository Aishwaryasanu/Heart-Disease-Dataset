Heart Disease dataset:
Heart Disease Prediction

Objective
Harness the power of tree-based machine learning models to predict heart disease. Learn how Decision Trees and Random Forests make decisions, identify important risk factors, and build robust and interpretable models for classification.

Tools
* Python 3.x
* Scikit-learn
* Graphviz
* Pandas & NumPy

Project Overview
This project walks you through a full ML workflow using the Heart Disease dataset:

1. Decision Tree Classifier
   * Train a decision tree to classify patients at risk of heart disease.
   * Visualize the branching logic to understand how the model reaches predictions.

2. Overfitting & Model Control
   * Analyze how a deep tree can overfit the data.
   * Apply depth constraints to balance accuracy and generalization.

3. Random Forest Classifier
   * Build an ensemble of trees to improve prediction stability and accuracy.
   * Compare performance with a single decision tree to see the advantage of Random Forests.

4. Feature Importance Analysis
   * Identify the key factors contributing to heart disease risk.
   * Gain insight into critical health indicators such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and age.

5. Cross-Validation & Evaluation
   * Use k-fold cross-validation to assess model reliability.
   * Ensure predictions are consistent and trustworthy.

Dataset
* Heart Disease Dataset (from UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle)
* Features include: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG results, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-induced Angina, ST depression, and more.
* Target: Presence or absence of heart disease (binary classification).

Key Takeaways
* Visualize how decision trees make predictions on patient health data.
* Compare single-tree models with Random Forest ensembles for higher accuracy and stability.
* Understand which health features are most influential in predicting heart disease.
* Evaluate models systematically with cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
